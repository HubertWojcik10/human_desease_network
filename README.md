# Human Disease Network

A network analysis university project, where we created a network, where edges represented associations between genes and deseases. 

## Our research question:
> If we could treat gene mutations with the [CRISPR](https://crisprtx.com/gene-editing/crispr-cas9) method, which genes should be targeted first?

We used different network analysis techniques to understand the complex relation between genes and diseases. Please refer to the included presentation for detailed information on our methods, experiments, and findings.

## Important Details
- group work: our team consisted of 5 people
- dataset source: https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Datasets#biological-networks
- the submission was a group presentation
